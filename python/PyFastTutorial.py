#Python is used for: general purpose
#py is very easy to learn, versatile, and easy to write
#Core advantage(s): simple, ez syntax, fast dev

______________________________________________________________
#Core Data Types:
#Int- Any whole number with no decimal
#Float- Any number with a decimal
#String- Any quoted text of a sequence of characters
#-Single vs double quotes doesn't matter, just be consistent
#to embed quotes use opposite quote type to wrap
#Bool or Boolean- one of two values. true or false, 1 or 0

#These are your 4 core data types

#Output & Printing

print("Hello World")
#print is the simple function to output to a console on run
#Hello World is the string
#you can only print data types.
#You can pass arguments into Print functions

print("Hello", "end", 87, False, end="\n" )
print("Hello")

#"\n" moves you to the next line

#Lets talk variables
#In python they're easy to create:
#variable name + space + equal sign + some value.
#Variables store information for recall at a later time.

hello = "sam"
world = "world"

print(hello, world)

#Variable naming conventions:
#1) no special characters except underscore
#2) cannot start with a number
#3) in python underscores typically denote spaces
